<h1 class = "toptext">How is Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome diagnosed?</h1>
    <p class = "abouttext"> It can be difficult to diagnose Sj&ouml;gren's. No single test will confirm the diagnosis and, Sj&ouml;gren's may appear in many different forms in different patients. Physicians may conduct a series of tests and ask about symptoms. An international group of experts has formulated classification criteria for Sj&ouml;gren's which will help your doctor arrive at  diagnosis. These criteria consider dryness symptoms, changes in salivary (mouth) and lacrimal (eye) gland function, and systemic (whole body) findings.

    <p>Blood tests you may have include:</p>
        <ul id = "tablefont">
            <li>ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody): Found in 70% of Sj&ouml;gren's patients and people with other autoimmune diseases.</li>
            <li>RF (Rheumatoid Factor): Antibody found in 60-70% of Sj&ouml;gren's patients and people with rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
            <li>SS-A (or Ro) and SS-B (or La): Marker antibodies for Sj&ouml;gren's. 70% of Sj&ouml;gren's patients are positive for SS-A and 40% are positive for SS-B. Also found in lupus patients</li>
            <li>ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate): Measures inflammation. An elevated ESR can indicate an inflammatory disorder, including Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome.</li>
            </ul>
    
    <p>Eye tests you may have include:</p>
    <ul id = "tablefont">
        <li>Schirmer test: Measures tear production.</li>
        <li>Rose Bengal and Lissamine Green: Use dyes to examine the surface of the eye for dry spots.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Dental tests you may have include:</p>
    <ul id = "tablefont">
        <li>Salivary flow: Measures the amount of saliva produced over a certain period of time.</li>
        <li>Salivary scintigraphy: A nuclear medicine test that measures salivary gland function.</li>
        <li>Salivary gland biopsy (usually in the lower lip): Confirms lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p><br></p>
    
    <p class = "abouttext"> Your physician will consider the results of these tests and his or her examination to arrive at a final diagnosis. Further research is being conducted to refine the diagnostic criteria for Sj&ouml;gren's and to help make diagnosis easier and more accurate.<br><br></p>
