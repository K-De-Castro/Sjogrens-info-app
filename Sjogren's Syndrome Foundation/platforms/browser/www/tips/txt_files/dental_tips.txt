Due to alterations in salivary function, Sjögren’s syndrome patients have many dental problems. They
have been found to require a greater number of dental visits, to have more decay and restorative
needs, and to spend a significant amount more (2 to 3 times) on dental care.

In order to maintain the best oral health and minimize expense, you should:
•	 Schedule dental examinations regularly – at least twice a year.
•	 Brush your teeth after every meal. Prompt removal of food debris will minimize decay. Rinse
your mouth with plain water if you don’t have time to brush.
•	 Use dental floss daily.
•	 Use a toothpaste containing fluoride. Discuss with your dentist using supplemental fluoride,
either as a daily rinse or gel in a carrier or applied in the dental office.
•	 Brush your tongue with a toothbrush or tongue-scraper. Buy an electric toothbrush.
•	 Avoid sugary, sticky foods which promote decay-causing bacteria.
•	 Do not wear removable dental prostheses at night, and clean and soak them in an anti-fungal
preparation daily.
•	 Discuss with your dentist the use of a remineralizing product to help prevent decay.
•	 Eat a healthful diet low in refined sugars and avoid carbohydrate-rich between-meal snacks.
•	 Use products to stimulate salivation (such as gums or candies) or to promote oral comfort but
be certain they are sugar-free and contain xylitol as a sweetener.
•	 Don’t smoke – cigarettes, cigars or pipes – or use chewing tobacco.
•	 Take advantage of fluoride-containing and -releasing dental restorative materials.
•	 Check the Sjögren’s Syndrome Foundation Product Directory – free of charge to all members –
to see available products.
