Get an accurate diagnosis! There are several things that can cause burning in the
oral cavity, including:



Fungal infections
Sores in the mouth due to autoimmune dysfunction (aphthous ulcers, geographic
tongue, lichen planus, etc.)
Nutritional deficiencies
Uncontrolled diseases (thyroid, diabetes, etc.)
Ill-fitting dental appliances or broken restorations
Dry mouth

Tips, if the cause of the burning falls into any of the categories listed above:






Treat the underlying condition – for example, salivary stimulants in dry mouth patients.
Steer clear of highly spiced foods, as these can irritate the mucosal lining of the mouth.
Avoid carbonated beverages, alcohol, and natural citrus juices, as these may aggravate
the burning.
Avoid citrus foods such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits, kiwis, pineapples and
strawberries. Acidic foods may aggravate the burning.
Avoid eating hard, dry foods or take small sips of water to help break them down, as
they may aggravate existing sores or ulcers.

If none of those conditions are the cause of the burning, you may have true
Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) which is thought to be a form of neuropathic
pain.

This is a chronic condition.
We do not know what causes BMS, nor do we have a cure.
Medications used to treat neurologic disorders (anxiety, depression) can alleviate the
burning.
Stress management reduction techniques such as meditation, yoga, exercise, and/or
psychotherapy may be helpful.
There is NO association with BMS and oral cancer.
