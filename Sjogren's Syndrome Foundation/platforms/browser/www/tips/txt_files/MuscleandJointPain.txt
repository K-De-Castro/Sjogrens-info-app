Joint and muscle pain in Sjogren’s syndrome may result from a variety of causes including
inflammation, fibromyalgia, age-related osteoarthritis, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism etc.
Work with your rheumatologist to identify the specific cause(s) of your pain and find the best
treatment regimen for you. Maintain a positive attitude and be an active partner in the management
of your pain. The tips below will also help.
Become knowledgeable about your medications.
Get a good night’s sleep.

•	 Maintain a regular sleep schedule.

Consider taking a warm bath before going to bed.
•	 Make your bedroom as quiet and comfortable as possible.
•	 Avoid caffeine and alcohol late in the day.

Exercise regularly with the goals of improving your overall fitness and
keeping your joints moving, the muscles around your joints strong and
