    <p class = "abouttext">Nine out of ten Sj&ouml;gren's patients are women. The average age of diagnosis is around 40, although it can occur in all age groups (including children) and in both sexes.<br><br></p>
    
<h3 class = "toptext"> Is there a cure?</h3>
    <p class = "abouttext"> Not yet. But with your help, there will be. Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome is serious but generally not fatal if complications are diagnosed and treated early. Sj&ouml;gren's patients must be monitored carefully for development of internal organ involvement, related autoimmune diseases, and other serious complications. In particular, patients should be aware that the incidence of lymphomas (cancer of the lymph glands) is significantly higher in people with Sj&ouml;gren's compared to the general population. <br></p>
