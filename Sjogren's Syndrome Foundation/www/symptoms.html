<h1 class = "toptext">What are the symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome?</h1>
    <p class = "abouttext"> Symptoms vary from person to person but may include a dry, gritty, or burning sensation in the eyes; dry mouth; difficulty talking, chewing, or swallowing; a sore or cracked tongue; dry or burning throat; dry, peeling lips; a change in taste or smell; increased dental decay; joint pain; vaginal and skin dryness; digestive problems; dry nose; and fatigue. <br><br></p>
    
    <p class = "abouttext">Sj&ouml;gren's often is undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome may mimic those of menopause, drug side effects, or medical conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronicfatigue syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. Because all symptoms are not always present at the same time and because Sj&ouml;gren's can involve several body systems, physicians and dentists sometimes treat each symptom individually and do not recognize that a systemic disease is present. The average time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis is over four years<br><br> </p>
