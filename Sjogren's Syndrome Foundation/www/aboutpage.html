        <h1>About</h1>
        <p id = "abouttext"> The Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome Foundation is proud to be the only national non-profit organization focused on increasing research, education and awareness for Sj&ouml;gren's. <br> <br> When we were founded in 1983 the mission was simple: help patients cope with their Sj&ouml;gren's, increase awareness, and support Sj&ouml;gren's research efforts. Today, our mission has remained the same while we have grown into a multi-faceted organization that has expanded its  outreach, increased its funding for research and education, and  continued to raise awareness for this common, yet little known disease. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p> Today, the foundation:</p>
        <ul id = "tablefont">

            <li>Conducts professional awareness initiatives and conferences to increase physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionalâ€™s knowledge of Sj&ouml;gren's.</li>
            <li>Expands general awareness of Sj&ouml;gren's by partnering with national and local media outlets.</li>
