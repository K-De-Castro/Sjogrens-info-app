at ACR 2016 Luncheon Program and Sjögren’s Quarterly Article Vol 11(3) 2016.

Sjögren’s is an autoimmune inflammatory disease targeting exocrine glands, including the
vestibular glands (vulva). Lymphocytic perivascular infiltration of predominately CD4+ T-helper
cells can result in gland destruction and decrease in lubrication by glairy fluid. Vaginal dryness and
itching, painful intercourse (dyspareunia) and frequent yeast infections contribute to decrease in
QOL, including sexual dysfunction.

In addition to vaginal dryness (common), the following occur in Sjögren’s:
n	Lichen planus and Lichen sclerosis
n	Vaginal yeast infections
n	Cervical dysplasia and cancer, especially in setting of HPV (human papilloma virus)
n	Interstitial cystitis (~10%) | pelvic pain relieved by voiding; urgency, and frequency
n	Endometriosis (4-fold increase) | pelvic pain around menses, excessive bleeding, back pain,
painful urination
n	Primary ovarian failure (20%) | premature menopause, infertility

Treatment Tips
n	Topical estrogen products (vaginal cream, pill, ring) or systemic Hormone Replacement
Therapy (HRT)
n	Topical lubricants for dryness (see SSF Product Directory for a list of vaginal moisturizers)
n	PAP or visual inspection (if prior hysterectomy) every 1-2 years;| PAP yearly and colposcopy for
high risk patients
n	Lichen planus or sclerosis may warrant topical steroids
n	Antifungals (topical or oral) for frequent or severe vaginal yeast infections
n	Refer to Urogynecologist for interstitial cystitis and pelvic pain symptoms
